changelog: >
  v0.9.11.0 - Title Override Map (replaces Language Booster)
  - NEW: Title Override Map — map series titles directly to TVDb IDs for guaranteed artwork matches
  - NEW: Direct TVDb ID lookup bypasses search ambiguity entirely
  - CHANGED: Replaced Language Booster (presets, word translations, article/and substitution) with simple title overrides
  - REMOVED: Language preset system, 10 language JSON files, /Xtream/Languages API endpoints
  - KEPT: Name-based TVDb search for series without overrides
  - KEPT: Language indicator stripping (e.g., "(NL Gesproken)" removed before search)
  - EFFECT: Simpler configuration — just paste "SeriesTitle=TVDbID" for unmatched series
  - EFFECT: Find TVDb IDs at thetvdb.com (number in the series URL)

  v0.9.8.0 - Eager Jellyfin Database Population
  - NEW: Eagerly populates jellyfin.db after cache refresh for instant browsing
  - NEW: Iterates through all series, seasons, and episodes to pre-populate database
  - FIX: Continues population even when individual items have bad provider data
  - EFFECT: Browse series instantly without waiting for lazy loading
  - EFFECT: ~20-30 min population time for large libraries (666 series, 10k episodes)

  v0.9.7.0 - Cache Acceleration (3x faster sync)
  - NEW: Parallel series processing with configurable parallelism (default: 3 concurrent)
  - NEW: Request throttling to prevent rate limiting (configurable delay between requests)
  - NEW: UI sliders for parallelism (1-10) and throttle delay (0-500ms) in Series settings
  - PERF: Eliminated double series API calls by caching series lists during first pass
  - PERF: Added GetEpisodesFromSeriesInfo helper to avoid redundant API calls per season
  - PERF: HashSet-based episode deduplication (O(1) instead of O(n) lookups)
  - EFFECT: Cache refresh ~3x faster (666 series: 17 min -> 5 min with default settings)
  - EFFECT: Single API call per series instead of 1 + N (where N = number of seasons)

  v0.9.6.0 - HTTP Retry Handler and Missing Episodes Fix
  - NEW: HTTP retry with exponential backoff for transient API failures (HTTP 5xx)
  - NEW: Failure tracking service to skip known-bad URLs for 24 hours
  - NEW: Configurable retry settings (attempts, delay, failure cache TTL)
  - FIX: Missing episodes now found via two-phase lookup (dictionary key + Season property)
  - FIX: Episodes stored under wrong dictionary key are now discovered
  - EFFECT: Cache refresh completes with ~95% success rate (up from ~88%)
  - EFFECT: All episodes display correctly regardless of provider API structure

  v0.9.5.3 - Fix malformed JSON from Xtream API
  - FIX: Handle cases where Xtream API returns JSON array instead of object for series data
  - FIX: Prevents cache failures for series with malformed API responses
  - IMPROVEMENT: Better error logging for JSON deserialization failures
  - EFFECT: Series that previously failed to cache now load successfully with empty data

  v0.9.5.2 - Clear Cache now cleans up jellyfin.db
  - FIX: Clear Cache button now triggers Jellyfin channel refresh after invalidating plugin cache
  - EFFECT: When cache is cleared, plugin falls back to API, Jellyfin updates jellyfin.db with fresh data
  - EFFECT: Orphaned items in jellyfin.db are removed when they no longer exist in API response
  - Full cache clear cycle: Plugin cache cleared → Jellyfin refresh → API fetch → DB updated
