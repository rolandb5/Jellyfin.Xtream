changelog: >
  v0.9.5.3 - Fix malformed JSON from Xtream API
  - FIX: Handle cases where Xtream API returns JSON array instead of object for series data
  - FIX: Prevents cache failures for series with malformed API responses
  - IMPROVEMENT: Better error logging for JSON deserialization failures
  - EFFECT: Series that previously failed to cache now load successfully with empty data

  v0.9.5.2 - Clear Cache now cleans up jellyfin.db
  - FIX: Clear Cache button now triggers Jellyfin channel refresh after invalidating plugin cache
  - EFFECT: When cache is cleared, plugin falls back to API, Jellyfin updates jellyfin.db with fresh data
  - EFFECT: Orphaned items in jellyfin.db are removed when they no longer exist in API response
  - Full cache clear cycle: Plugin cache cleared → Jellyfin refresh → API fetch → DB updated
