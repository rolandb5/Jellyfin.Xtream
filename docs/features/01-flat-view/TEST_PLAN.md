# Flat View Feature - Test Plan

## Document Info
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Date:** 2026-01-27
- **Feature Version:** 0.9.1.0
- **Test Environment:** Jellyfin 10.11.0+, .NET 9.0

---

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Jellyfin 10.11.0 or later
- Jellyfin Xtream plugin v0.9.1.0+
- Active Xtream provider account
- Multiple categories with content

### Test Data Requirements
- **Minimum:** 3 categories, 10 series, 5 movies
- **Recommended:** 5+ categories, 50+ series, 20+ movies
- **Stress Test:** 10+ categories, 200+ series, 100+ movies

---

## Testing Approach

**Manual Testing Only:** This test plan covers manual testing procedures. The Jellyfin.Xtream project does not currently have a unit test framework configured.

**Future Consideration:** If unit tests are added to the project, the following areas would benefit from automated testing:
- `GetAllSeriesFlattened()` with mocked cache/API responses
- `GetAllStreamsFlattened()` with mocked API responses
- Alphabetical sorting of channel items
- Configuration flag behavior (FlattenSeriesView, FlattenVodView)

---
