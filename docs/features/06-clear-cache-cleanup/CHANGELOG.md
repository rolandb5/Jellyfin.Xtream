## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from Pre-v0.9.5.2

**Before:**
- Clear Cache only invalidated plugin cache
- Jellyfin DB retained orphaned items
- Manual Jellyfin refresh required for cleanup

**After (v0.9.5.2+):**
- Clear Cache invalidates plugin cache
- Clear Cache triggers Jellyfin DB cleanup
- Orphaned items removed automatically

**Steps:**
1. Upgrade plugin to v0.9.5.2 or later
2. No additional configuration required
3. Use Clear Cache as normal - now with enhanced cleanup

**Data Migration:** None required

**Rollback:** Downgrade plugin; manual Jellyfin refresh still available

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
| Dependency | Version | Impact if Changed |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| `SeriesCacheService` | v0.9.5.0+ | Breaking |
| `TaskService` | v0.9.5.0+ | Medium (graceful degradation) |

### External Dependencies

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Async Completion**
   - Jellyfin refresh is async; completion time unknown
   - User may see stale data briefly before refresh completes

2. **No Progress Indicator**
   - Plugin UI doesn't show Jellyfin refresh progress
   - User must check Jellyfin scheduled tasks for status

3. **Trigger Failure Silent**
   - If Jellyfin trigger fails, only warning shown
   - User must manually trigger Jellyfin refresh

---

## Future Enhancements

See [REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md) "Out of Scope" for potential improvements:

- Progress indicator for Jellyfin refresh
- Confirmation dialog before clear
- Selective clear (specific categories)
- VOD cache clear (when implemented)

**Status:** 💡 Ideas only, no active development

---

## Upstream Contribution Status

### PR Readiness: 🟡 Needs Review

**Considerations:**
- Feature tightly coupled with eager caching
- May need to be bundled with Feature 04 PR
- Requires upstream to have TaskService integration

**Recommendation:** Include with eager caching PR as enhancement

---

## Testing History

### v0.9.5.2 - Initial Testing
- **Date:** 2026-01-26
- **Scope:** Full manual test suite (18 test cases)
- **Results:** 16/16 testable cases passing (100%)
- **Skipped:** 2 (error conditions hard to simulate)
- **Environment:** Jellyfin 10.11.0, 215 series

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Clear Cache doesn't remove items from Jellyfin UI
- **Cause:** Jellyfin refresh hasn't completed yet
- **Fix:** Wait 30 seconds, refresh browser

**Issue:** Message shows "Warning: Could not trigger Jellyfin cleanup"
- **Cause:** Jellyfin scheduled tasks disabled or error
- **Fix:** Manually trigger "Refresh Channels" in Jellyfin Dashboard → Scheduled Tasks

**Issue:** Stale items remain after clear
- **Cause:** Browser cache
- **Fix:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or clear browser cache

### Debug Steps
1. Check Jellyfin logs for "Cache invalidated"
2. Check Jellyfin logs for "Refresh Channels" task execution
3. Verify plugin version is 0.9.5.2+
4. Try manual Jellyfin task trigger
