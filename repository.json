Check server logs.', you'll now see messages like:\n- 'Failed: Cannot resolve server hostname. Check Base URL.'\n- 'Failed: Connection refused. Server may be down or Base URL is incorrect.'\n- 'Failed: Request timeout. Server may be slow or unreachable.'\n\nThis makes it much easier to diagnose and fix connection problems without having to dig through server logs.",
