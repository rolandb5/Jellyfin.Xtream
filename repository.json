Plugin cache is populated from Xtream API (fast, parallel)\n2. Jellyfin database is populated from cache (slower, sequential)\n3. All items are pre-stored in jellyfin.db\n4. User browses instantly without any API calls or cache lookups",

Higher values (5-10) are faster but may trigger rate limiting.",
